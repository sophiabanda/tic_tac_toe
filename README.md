# tic_tac_toe

This game of Tic Tac Toe started as a basic vanilla javascript application I built in class. I since have used this as an opportunity to build a react app from scratch, without the use of CRA, and refactoring it to work with the previous CSS and functionality. It resulted in a cleaner application with stronger functionality, better resizability and more potential!

I am proud of it's clean and simple aesthetic that also suggests natual penmanhip.

Thanks for visiting, and feel free to give it a try where it's hosted at: [Tic Tac Toe](https://sophiabanda.github.io/tic_tac_toe/)!
